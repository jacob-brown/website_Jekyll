I am interested in revealing population demographics and histories through a genetic lens. I am currently studying Computational Methods in Evolution and Ecology (MRes) at Imperial College London. Previously I spent 3 years working at a research site in the Kalahari desert studying habituated Meerkats (*Suricata suricatta*).

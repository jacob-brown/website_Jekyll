I am interested in assessing genetic data to uncover demographic and spatial information of populations. I am currently studying Computational Methods in Evolution and Ecology (MRes) at Imperial College London. Previously I spent 3 years working at a research site in the Kalahari desert studying habituated Meerkats (*Suricata suricatta*).
